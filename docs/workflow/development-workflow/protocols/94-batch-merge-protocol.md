# Protocol: Batch Merge

**Agent role**: Developer (or Portfolio Orchestrator when invoked from Protocol 90)
**Purpose**: Merge all ready PRs in a parallel batch into the target integration branch (`develop` by default, or any epic integration branch) sequentially, auto-resolving trivial CHANGELOG and documentation conflicts (including duplicate section headers introduced by clean merges), pausing for human input on non-trivial ones, and running `post-merge-cleanup` for each successfully merged PR.

**Shell helper**: `scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh`

**Governance**: The agent assists with merge execution. The merge plan is printed for visibility before execution, but no interactive approval is required — merges proceed immediately after the plan is displayed.

---

## When to use this protocol

- A human invokes `/batch-merge` directly (Use Case 1 — human-invoked).
- The Portfolio Orchestrator detects that all PRs in a parallel batch have reached `ready-for-human-review` and routes to this protocol (Use Case 2 — orchestrator-invoked).

In both cases, the merge plan is displayed before any `git merge` runs, but execution proceeds immediately without waiting for user input.

---

## Step 1: Discovery — Build the Candidate List

### 1a. Invoke the discovery script

**Auto-discovery mode** (no explicit PR numbers provided):

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh discover
# Or, to merge into an epic integration branch instead of develop:
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh --base develop-<slug> discover
```

**Explicit PR list** (user supplied `#101 #102 #103` or `--prs 101,102,103`):

```bash
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh discover --prs 101,102,103
# Or, with an integration branch override:
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh --base develop-<slug> discover --prs 101,102,103
```

The `--base` flag is a global option placed **before** the subcommand name. It defaults to `develop` and must be passed consistently to `discover`, `merge`, and `delete-branch` when targeting an integration branch other than `develop`.

### 1b. Handle the discovery result

Parse the output. Each PR candidate is a block of `KEY=VALUE` lines terminated by `---`.

- If `DISCOVERY_RESULT=none` (auto-discovery mode only): exit immediately with the message:

  > No PRs labeled `ready-for-human-review` found targeting `<base>`. Nothing to merge.

  where `<base>` is the value passed to `--base` (defaults to `develop`). Stop — no side effects.

- If `DISCOVERY_RESULT=found`: collect all PR blocks into a candidate list.

  When the user supplied an explicit PR list the script proceeds to per-PR readiness checks regardless of label status (some may not have the `ready-for-human-review` label — those are handled in Step 2).

  If discovery warns that a PR is labeled `human-checkpoint-required`, treat it
  as skipped until the named checkpoint is satisfied or waived. Do not add it
  back to the candidate list just because `ready-for-human-review` is present.
  To inspect an explicitly supplied checkpointed PR in the candidate table after
  human confirmation, rerun discovery with `--include-checkpointed`; merge mode
  will still refuse the stale label, so the checkpoint lifecycle helper must
  record `satisfied` or `waived` evidence and sync labels before the merge step.

### 1c. Display the candidate summary table

Print a summary table so the human can see what was discovered before any gate or merge:

```text
Candidate PRs for batch merge
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Order │  PR #  │ Title                             │ Branch              │ Labels
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1   │  #101  │ feat: add widget                  │ feature/101-widget  │ ready-for-human-review
   2   │  #103  │ fix: correct typo                 │ fix/103-typo        │ ready-for-human-review
   3   │  #102  │ feat: update docs                 │ feature/102-docs    │ ready-for-human-review, CHANGELOG
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Merge order: non-CHANGELOG PRs first (ascending PR #), then CHANGELOG PRs (ascending PR #).
```

Fields: Order, PR number, title, branch name, labels, readiness status.

---

## Step 2: Readiness Gate

For each candidate PR:

1. If `PR_READY_LABEL=true` — it passes the gate automatically. No action needed.

2. If `PR_READY_LABEL=false` — display a warning:

   > **Warning**: PR #N — _title_ — is missing the `ready-for-human-review` label.
   > Include it anyway or skip it?
   >
   > - Type **include** to proceed with a "not fully reviewed" notation.
   > - Type **skip** to exclude it from this run (outcome: `skipped_not_ready`).

   Record the human's decision. If the human does not respond or exits, treat as **skip**.

3. Do not silently skip or silently include an unready PR. The human must explicitly decide.

4. If `PR_HAS_HUMAN_CHECKPOINT=true`, display a warning:

   > **Warning**: PR #N — _title_ — still requires a human checkpoint.
   > The required action must be completed and recorded before this batch can
   > merge it.
   >
   > - Type **satisfied** only after the checkpoint lifecycle evidence records
   >   `satisfied` or `waived` and the `human-checkpoint-required` label has
   >   been synced away.
   > - Type **skip** to exclude it from this run (outcome:
   >   `skipped_human_checkpoint`).

   Do not proceed on a verbal "include" alone. The merge helper refuses a stale
   `human-checkpoint-required` label, so the concrete action is to satisfy or
   waive the checkpoint, rerun label sync, rerun discovery, and continue only
   after `PR_HAS_HUMAN_CHECKPOINT=false`.

After Step 2, update the candidate list: remove any PRs the human chose to skip and mark them `skipped_not_ready` in the tracking state.

---

## Step 3: Merge Plan Display

Display the final merge plan (only PRs approved so far) and proceed immediately:

```text
Merge plan (will be executed in this order)
──────────────────────────────────────────
  1. PR #101  feature/101-widget     (no CHANGELOG conflict expected)
  2. PR #102  feature/102-docs       (no CHANGELOG conflict expected)
  3. PR #103  fix/103-docs-update    (may cause CHANGELOG conflict — will auto-resolve)

Skipped (not ready): #104
```

After printing the plan, proceed directly to Step 3.5 without waiting for user input.

---

## Step 3.5: Pre-Merge Clean-State Check

Before starting the sequential merge loop, verify that the main working tree (the checkout that will receive the merges) is clean and on the expected integration branch:

```bash
# Verify branch — use the same --base value passed to batch-merge.sh
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
EXPECTED_BRANCH="${TARGET_BASE:-develop}"   # develop, or the --base override
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$EXPECTED_BRANCH" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: main working tree is on '$CURRENT_BRANCH', expected '$EXPECTED_BRANCH'. Aborting batch merge."
  exit 1
fi

# Verify no uncommitted modifications
DIRTY=$(git status --porcelain)
if [ -n "$DIRTY" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: main working tree has uncommitted modifications. Aborting batch merge."
  echo "$DIRTY"
  echo "Resolve or discard these changes before running batch merge."
  exit 1
fi
```

If either check fails, **stop immediately** and report to the human. Do not attempt any merges with a dirty or mis-branched working tree — leaked modifications may be incorporated into merge commits and corrupt the base branch.

**Defense-in-depth note**: Protocol 90 Step 5.2 runs an equivalent check immediately after each Work Item Runner returns — before any orchestrator action, including batch-merge handoff. This Step 3.5 check is a second line of defense for cases where Step 5.2 was not run (e.g., manual invocation of batch-merge, or a non-parallel-batch context). Both checks are required; neither substitutes for the other.

---

## Step 4: Sequential Merge Loop

Process PRs one at a time in the approved order.

### 4.1 Per-PR merge attempt

> **Critical sequencing rule**: Call `batch-merge.sh merge --pr N` for **exactly one PR at a
> time**, inspect `MERGE_RESULT`, and fully resolve the outcome (merge success, conflict
> resolution, or abort) **before** advancing to the next PR. Never wrap multiple merge
> calls in a single non-interactive shell loop (e.g., `for pr in …; do … merge --pr $pr; done`)
> — if one PR leaves the working tree in a conflicted state, subsequent calls will fail with
> "Could not check out '<base>' — working tree is not clean" and all remaining PRs will be
> lost. The sequential discipline is mandatory even when all PRs are expected to be conflict-free.

For each PR in the approved order:

**a. Announce the merge attempt:**

> Merging PR #N: _title_ (branch: _branch_)...

**b. Run the merge script:**

```bash
# Standard (merging into develop):
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh merge --pr <number>

# Integration-branch override (merging into develop-<slug> or other base):
./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh --base develop-<slug> merge --pr <number>
# Equivalent using the env var form:
# TARGET_BASE=develop-<slug> ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh merge --pr <number>
```

Parse the output:

- `MERGE_RESULT=clean` → merge succeeded with no conflicts. Check `CHANGELOG_DEDUPED` (see below), then proceed to **4.2 Post-merge steps**.
- `MERGE_RESULT=conflict` → conflicts detected. Proceed to **4.3 Conflict classification**.
- `MERGE_RESULT=failed` → unexpected failure. Report:

  > Failed to merge PR #N: _ERROR_MESSAGE_. Skipping.

  Record outcome as `failed`. Continue with the next PR.

**`CHANGELOG_DEDUPED` field (clean merges only)**: When `MERGE_RESULT=clean`, the script also emits `CHANGELOG_DEDUPED=true|false` to indicate whether the post-merge CHANGELOG deduplication guard ran and made changes.

- `CHANGELOG_DEDUPED=false` → no duplicate section headers were found (normal case).
- `CHANGELOG_DEDUPED=true` → the merge introduced duplicate `### Category` headers within `[Unreleased]` (e.g., two `### Fixed` sections). The script auto-consolidated them and amended the merge commit before pushing. Include a note in the Step 5 summary under the merged PR's outcome (use outcome code `merged_clean` with a parenthetical `(CHANGELOG deduped)` suffix).

This guard prevents the scenario where a clean git merge silently produces a structurally invalid CHANGELOG (no conflict markers, but two `### Fixed` blocks in the same `## [Unreleased]` section). If a `WARNING` about residual duplicates appears in the script's stderr output, the automatic consolidation did not fully resolve all duplicates — a manual fix to `CHANGELOG.md` on `develop` is required before the next batch merge.

**Abort-at-any-time gate**: Before starting each PR, check whether the human has signaled an abort (e.g., by typing "abort" at any prompt). If yes, mark all remaining PRs as `not_attempted` and jump to Step 5.

### 4.2 Post-merge steps (after a successful merge)

After a clean or resolved merge, in order:

1. **Push the base branch to origin and mark the PR as merged on GitHub:**

   As of the fix for issue #412, `batch-merge.sh merge` now performs the push and the
   `gh pr merge` call internally before returning `MERGE_RESULT=clean`. You do **not**
   need to run a separate `git push origin <base>` step — the script already did it.

   If you are running a resolved-conflict merge (Step 4.3) and need to commit the
   resolution before continuing, run `git push origin <base>` after staging and
   committing the resolved files. The script does not handle the post-conflict push.

2. **Verify GitHub recognizes the PR as merged** (not just closed):

   ```bash
   gh pr view <number> --json state --jq '.state'
   ```

   Expected output: `MERGED`.
   - If the state is not `MERGED` after up to 30 seconds (poll every 5 s): report `failed` for this PR, do not delete the remote branch or run cleanup, and continue with the next PR.
   - If the script emitted a `WARNING: gh pr merge failed` line to stderr, that is a signal that this MERGED-state check is especially important — the push succeeded but the GitHub merge-mark may have failed.

   > **Failure mode — CLOSED instead of MERGED (historical context)**: Before issue
   > #412 was fixed, `batch-merge.sh` did a local `git merge` but neither pushed nor
   > called `gh pr merge`, so GitHub left PRs in `OPEN` state. The fix adds `git push`
   > and `gh pr merge --merge` inside `cmd_merge()` immediately after a successful
   > local merge. When `gh pr merge` fails for a non-idempotent reason, a warning is
   > emitted to stderr and this MERGED-state poll acts as the safety net. The
   > `delete-branch` subcommand also enforces the MERGED-state guard before deletion.

   > **Exceptional reviewer access bypass**: If a PR was excluded from the
   > normal batch route because `run-epic-delegated-gate.sh` returned
   > `exceptional_bypass_authorized`, do not merge it through `batch-merge.sh`.
   > The runner must use the exact named `gh pr merge <pr> --admin` command only
   > after verifying the PR/SHA/fingerprint authorization and pre-attempt
   > `reviewer-access-bypass` audit marker. After the one attempt, verify
   > GitHub's live PR state, update the same audit marker, fetch the refreshed
   > base, and rediscover the remaining batch PRs. This exception never applies
   > to unaffected PRs.

3. **Delete the remote branch** using the guarded helper (which re-checks MERGED
   state immediately before deletion to prevent the CLOSED-not-MERGED failure mode):

   ```bash
   ./scripts/development-workflow/batch-merge.sh delete-branch --pr <number>
   ```

   Parse the output:
   - `DELETE_RESULT=deleted` → branch was deleted successfully.
   - `DELETE_RESULT=not_found` → branch was already gone (auto-delete or prior run). No action needed.
   - `DELETE_RESULT=skipped` → branch was NOT deleted. The `ERROR_MESSAGE` field contains
     the reason, which falls into one of two sub-cases:
     - _PR not in MERGED state_: Do **not** delete the branch manually. Investigate why
       GitHub has not yet recognised the merge (e.g., push failed silently, network error)
       before retrying.
     - _Push failure_ (network/auth/permissions): Retry after resolving the underlying
       issue. The branch still exists on the remote.

4. **Run `post-merge-cleanup` for the merged branch.**

   > **Note on worktree cleanup**: Do **not** attempt to remove worktrees manually before
   > calling `post-merge-cleanup.sh`. The script already handles worktree detection and
   > removal internally — it checks for any worktree using the merged branch and removes it
   > (with locked-worktree handling) before deleting the local branch. Any manual worktree
   > removal step here is redundant and risks breaking the cleanup sequence.

   `post-merge-cleanup.sh` verifies or performs guarded remote cleanup for
   implementation branches. If `batch-merge.sh delete-branch` already removed
   the remote branch, `post-merge-cleanup.sh` reports
   `REMOTE_DELETE_RESULT=not_found` / `REMOTE_DELETE_STATUS=already_absent` and
   continues. If the remote implementation branch still exists, the helper
   deletes it only after confirming the PR is `MERGED`; if deletion fails, the
   cleanup is non-terminal.

   The helper requires a local branch to exist. Because `batch-merge.sh` merges
   via `origin/<branch>` without creating a local tracking branch, create a
   temporary local branch first:

   ```bash
   BRANCH="$(gh pr view <number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')"
   BASE_BRANCH="${TARGET_BASE:-develop}"
   # Try origin/<branch> first; fall back to HEAD~1 if the remote branch was
   # already deleted (e.g., repo has auto-delete enabled). HEAD~1 points to the
   # pre-merge develop commit, not the PR's tip, but post-merge-cleanup.sh only
   # needs the branch *name* to delete it — the commit it points to is irrelevant.
   git branch "$BRANCH" "origin/$BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || git branch "$BRANCH" HEAD~1 2>/dev/null || true
   ./scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh --base "$BASE_BRANCH" "$BRANCH"
   ```

   If cleanup fails: report the failure but **do not halt remaining merges**. The human can re-run cleanup manually.

5. Report the per-PR outcome immediately (see outcome codes in Step 5).

### 4.3 Conflict classification

When `MERGE_RESULT=conflict`, read `CONFLICTED_FILES` from the script output.

Classify each conflicted file:

#### CHANGELOG.md — trivial (auto-resolve)

Applies when `CHANGELOG.md` is in the conflict list.

Auto-resolution procedure:

1. Read the current (conflicted) content of `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Locate all `<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` conflict marker blocks within the `[Unreleased]` section.
3. Extract **all unique entries** from both the `HEAD` side (entries already in `develop`) and the incoming side (entries from the PR being merged).
4. Write the resolved content:
   - Entries from the `HEAD` side first, followed by entries from the incoming side.
   - No entries dropped.
   - Remove all conflict markers.
5. Stage the resolved file:

   ```bash
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   ```

6. Report:

   > Auto-resolved CHANGELOG.md: combined entries from `develop` and PR #N.
   > HEAD entries (kept first): [brief summary]
   > Incoming entries (appended): [brief summary]

#### Documentation / protocol files — potentially trivial

Applies when a conflicted file's path starts with `docs/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, or `.codex/`.

Check whether the changes are in **non-overlapping line ranges**:

- Read the conflict markers for this file.
- If the `HEAD` side and the incoming side touch **different lines** (no shared line numbers in conflict markers): auto-resolve by accepting both changes. Stage the file with `git add <file>`.
- If the conflict markers show **overlapping changes** (same lines modified on both sides): treat as **non-trivial** (see below).

Report auto-resolved files:

> Auto-resolved _file_: non-overlapping changes from `develop` and PR #N combined.

#### Non-trivial conflicts

Any conflict that is not in the above categories, or a documentation file with overlapping changes.

1. Display:

   > **Non-trivial conflict detected in PR #N**
   >
   > Conflicting files:
   >
   > - `path/to/file.sh`
   >
   > Conflict excerpt:
   >
   > ```text
   > <<<<<<< HEAD
   > [first 10 lines of HEAD side]
   > =======
   > [first 10 lines of incoming side]
   > >>>>>>> origin/<branch>
   > ```
   >
   > Please resolve the conflict in your editor, stage the resolved files, and then reply with:
   >
   > - **`resolved`** to complete the merge and continue.
   > - **`abort`** to cancel this PR's merge (develop will be returned to its pre-merge state).

2. **Wait for human response.**

3. If the human replies **`resolved`**:
   - Verify resolution: `git diff --check` must succeed (no conflict markers).
   - Complete the merge:

     ```bash
     git commit --no-edit
     ```

   - Record outcome as `merged_human`.
   - Proceed to **4.2 Post-merge steps**.

4. If the human replies **`abort`**:
   - Abort the merge to return `develop` to its pre-merge state:

     ```bash
     git merge --abort
     ```

   - Report:

     > Merge aborted. `develop` has been returned to its pre-merge state.
     > PR #N outcome: `skipped_conflict`.

   - Continue with the next PR.

#### Complete the merge after auto-resolution

When all conflicts have been classified and auto-resolved:

```bash
git commit --no-edit
```

Record outcome as `merged_auto`.

Proceed to **4.2 Post-merge steps**.

## Step 5: Final Summary

After all PRs have been processed (or the batch has been aborted), always print a structured summary:

```text
Batch Merge Summary
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 PR #  │ Title                       │ Outcome
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 #101  │ feat: add widget             │ merged_clean
 #102  │ feat: update CHANGELOG docs  │ merged_auto  (CHANGELOG combined)
 #103  │ fix: conflict fix            │ merged_human
 #104  │ feat: missing label          │ skipped_not_ready
 #105  │ fix: bad conflict            │ skipped_conflict
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Merged: 3  |  Skipped: 2  |  Failed: 0  |  Not attempted: 0
```

**Outcome codes**:

| Code                | Meaning                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `merged_clean`      | Merged without any conflicts                                                             |
| `merged_auto`       | Merged with auto-resolved trivial conflicts (CHANGELOG or non-overlapping doc files)     |
| `merged_human`      | Merged after human resolved non-trivial conflict(s)                                      |
| `skipped_not_ready` | Skipped because PR lacked `ready-for-human-review` and human chose to exclude it         |
| `skipped_conflict`  | Skipped because human aborted conflict resolution; `develop` returned to pre-merge state |
| `failed`            | Merge failed for an unexpected reason                                                    |
| `not_attempted`     | PR was not processed when human aborted the entire batch                                 |

Include details of any auto-resolved conflicts in the summary (which files, what entries were combined).

---

## Orchestrator-Invoked Mode (Use Case 2)

When called from the Portfolio Orchestrator (Protocol 90), the same flow applies:

- The orchestrator passes the PR list discovered from the batch.
- The merge plan is printed for visibility at Step 3, then execution proceeds immediately.
- The orchestrator must NOT skip or auto-approve the readiness gate (Step 2) for any unready PR.
- Non-trivial conflicts still require human resolution at Step 4.3.

The orchestrator should include the batch-merge summary in its overall `Step 6: Notify Humans` output.

---

## Safety Rules

- **The base branch must never be left in a conflicted state.** Every code path that encounters a conflict has either a resolution path or a `git merge --abort` fallback.
- **Do not use `gh pr close`.** The merge must be recognized by GitHub as a real merge, not a closed-unmerged PR.
- **Do not force-push** or rebase PR branches.
- **Already-merged PRs stay merged** even if the human aborts the batch mid-run.
- If `post-merge-cleanup` fails, report the failure and continue — do not halt remaining merges.
