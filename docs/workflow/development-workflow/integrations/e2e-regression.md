# Integration: E2E / Regression Tests

This template includes a label-gated GitHub Actions workflow for e2e/regression testing:

- `.github/workflows/e2e-regression.yml`

The placeholder workflow listens for PRs targeting `develop` or `main` when the
`ready-for-regression` label is present, but the placeholder job is disabled by
default. It installs dependencies and browsers only when the repository variable
`ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` is set to `true`.

The file is intentionally generic so downstream repositories can replace it with
their own label-gated test suites.

---

## How It Fits Into the Workflow

The `ready-for-regression` label is applied by the orchestrator (Step 7b in
`91-orchestrate-work-protocol.md`) after the automated reviewer loop (Step 7) is
clean, and before the CI loop (Step 8). The `pr-policy.yml` workflow also
auto-applies the label to same-repository implementation PRs on open, reopen, or
ready-for-review, and removes stale labels on new pushes only when the reviewer
loop has not yet posted its canonical summary. The prepare-release flow applies
the same label on production release PRs per `05-prepare-release-protocol.md`
Step 7.4. This means:

1. Step 7a: Internal review gate passes
2. Step 7: External automated reviewers are clean
3. **Step 7b: `ready-for-regression` label is applied** (triggers configured
   real regression checks, or this placeholder when explicitly enabled)
4. Step 8: CI loop polls `statusCheckRollup` — the e2e job appears as a check

Regression tests are expensive in time and compute, so they only run after all reviewer gates confirm the code is clean.

The CI loop (`pr-ci-loop.sh`) naturally picks up the e2e check result as part of its green/red polling. No script changes are needed.

## Label Gate Pattern

The workflow uses a two-part `if` condition:

```yaml
if: >-
  (github.event.action == 'labeled' && github.event.label.name == 'ready-for-regression') ||
  (github.event.action != 'labeled' && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ready-for-regression'))
```

- First clause: fires when the label is just applied
- Second clause: fires on `synchronize` (new push) or `reopened` if the label is already present

This means e2e tests re-run automatically after fixer pushes — the label stays on the PR, and `synchronize` triggers the second clause.

---

## Default Behavior

The template ships with a minimal Playwright project at `e2e/` that has one
always-passing baseline test. The placeholder workflow is inactive by default so
private downstream repositories do not install Playwright or browser
dependencies before regression is intentionally enabled.

To run the placeholder as a temporary validation check, create a repository
variable named `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` with value `true`. Remove
that variable or set it to any other value to return the placeholder to the
disabled default.

---

## What Downstream Repositories Should Customize

Replace the placeholder e2e project with project-specific tests:

1. Update `e2e/package.json` with your dependencies (Playwright, Cypress, etc.).
2. Configure `e2e/playwright.config.ts` (or equivalent) with your base URL, projects, web server, and auth setup.
3. Replace `e2e/tests/baseline.spec.ts` with real regression specs.
4. Update the workflow steps in `.github/workflows/e2e-regression.yml` if your test runner differs (e.g. different install commands, environment variables, artifact uploads).

You may also:

- Remove the `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER_REGRESSION` guard once the placeholder
  steps are replaced by a real suite that should always run after
  `ready-for-regression`.
- Add the real e2e/regression check as a required status check in branch
  protection rules.
- Split into multiple workflow files for different test suites (each gated on `ready-for-regression`).
- Add environment variables or secrets for test infrastructure.

---

## Scope

The `ready-for-regression` label is applied to implementation PRs (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `refactor/*`) and to **production** release PRs (`release/*` → `main`) per [`05-prepare-release-protocol.md`](../protocols/05-prepare-release-protocol.md) Step 7.4, so configured real e2e/regression checks can run before merge. Spec and plan PRs (`spec/*`, `implementation-plan/*`) skip this label and regression testing.

---

## Notes

- The label persists on the PR after e2e tests pass. It is removed from
  implementation PRs only when `pr-policy.yml` sees a new push before the
  reviewer-loop summary exists.
- This workflow does not store test credentials or environment URLs in the template.
- For projects without e2e tests, keep the placeholder disabled and do not
  configure it as a required check. The orchestrator will still apply the label,
  but the inactive placeholder will not spend runner minutes on browser setup.
- Use [`actions-cost-audit.md`](actions-cost-audit.md) when reviewing whether
  regression workflow run volume should stay as-is, be narrowed, or remain
  opt-in for downstream private repositories.
