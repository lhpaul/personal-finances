# Cross-Repository PR Flow

Use this guide from the workflow hub checkout when a hub-managed item routes
implementation work to a selected product repository.

## Ownership Model

| Artifact | Owner in workflow-hub product work |
| --- | --- |
| Tracker item | Workflow hub |
| Spec | Workflow hub |
| Implementation plan | Workflow hub |
| Product implementation branch | Selected product repository |
| Product PR | Selected product repository |
| Product CI | Selected product repository |
| Product reviewer loop | Selected product repository |
| Merge cleanup tracker update | Workflow hub |

Hub-only workflow improvements, such as updates to orchestration scripts or
workflow docs, still open implementation PRs in the hub repository.

## Route The Work Item

Run location: hub checkout.

Confirm the next action and selected product repository:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/workflow-next-action.sh \
  --repo faind-mobile-app \
  --development docs/specs/developments/20260611204735_882-workflow-hub-docs
```

The output should name the workflow mode, action repository kind, action
repository, and GitHub repository. Stop if product repository selection is
missing or ambiguous.

## Prepare The Product Checkout

Run location: hub checkout.

Inspect the product checkout:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/hub-status.sh --repo faind-mobile-app
```

Fast-forward a clean checkout:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/hub-sync-product-repos.sh --repo faind-mobile-app
```

If the checkout is dirty, resolve product-local changes in the product checkout
before continuing.

## Open Or Preview The Product PR

Run location: hub checkout.

Dry-run product PR creation before credentials or live writes:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/open-product-pr.sh \
  --repo faind-mobile-app \
  --base main \
  --approved-base main \
  --head feature/faind-example \
  --title "feat: add faind example" \
  --body-file /tmp/faind-product-pr-body.md \
  --dry-run
```

Live PR creation uses the selected product repository GitHub App credentials and
passes the installation token only to the child `gh pr create` invocation.
`--approved-base` is the parent-approved workflow base; if it differs from
`--base`, the helper stops before credentials or `gh pr create` are used.

## Run Reviewers And CI

Run location: hub checkout.

Run the reviewer loop against the product repository PR:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh 123 \
  --repo example/faind-mobile-app \
  --branch feature/faind-example
```

Run the CI loop against the product repository PR:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh 123 \
  --repo example/faind-mobile-app
```

Do not apply readiness labels until reviewer loop and CI are clean or only
acceptable advisory findings remain.

## Merge And Cleanup

Run location: hub checkout.

Use the repository merge protocol for the PR owner. For product PRs, the target
repository is the selected product repository. After merge, run cleanup from
the hub so tracker state remains hub-owned:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/post-merge-cleanup.sh \
  --repo faind-mobile-app \
  feature/faind-example
```

Verify:

- Product PR state is `MERGED`.
- Product branch cleanup completed.
- Hub tracker status moved to `Merged` when the implementation closes the item.
- The hub checkout returns to the integration branch for the topic.

## Troubleshooting

### Failed CI

Symptom: `pr-ci-loop.sh` reports `RESULT=red`.

Confirm from the hub checkout:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/pr-ci-loop.sh 123 --repo example/faind-mobile-app
```

Safe repair:

- Inspect the failing product repository check logs.
- Fix the product branch in the selected product checkout.
- Push the fix and rerun reviewer loop and CI.

### Reviewer-Loop Failures

Symptom: `pr-review-loop.sh` reports `needs_fixes`, `escalate`, or
`reviewer-failed`.

Confirm from the hub checkout:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh 123 \
  --repo example/faind-mobile-app \
  --branch feature/faind-example
```

Safe repair:

- Address blocking findings in the selected product checkout.
- Treat low-value advisory findings as acceptable only when they do not
  materially improve correctness, security, maintainability, or test coverage.
- Rerun reviewer loop before applying readiness labels.

### Missing Product Checkout

Symptom: routing or cleanup cannot resolve `faind-mobile-app`.

Confirm from the hub checkout:

```bash
scripts/development-workflow/hub-status.sh --repo faind-mobile-app
```

Safe repair:

- Add or correct the local checkout path in `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml`.
- Re-run status and sync before mutating product files.

### Dirty Product Repo

Symptom: sync or cleanup refuses to operate on the product checkout.

Safe repair:

- Inspect product-local changes directly.
- Commit, stash, or intentionally remove those changes using the product
  repository's normal workflow.
- Re-run `hub-status.sh --repo faind-mobile-app`.

### Missing App Credentials

Symptom: `open-product-pr.sh` reports missing app metadata or private key
access.

Safe repair:

- Verify non-secret App ID and installation ID in `.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`.
- Verify local credential references in `.ai-dev-workflow.local.yaml`.
- Use `github-app-token.sh --repo faind-mobile-app --dry-run` before live PR
  creation.
- Stop if the credential source is unavailable; do not use unrelated ambient
  credentials.
