       ./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh unlock <pr-number>

Runs the automated PR review loop for one or more platforms in sequence. Before
triggering a new review, each platform checks for existing blocking findings. If
any platform reports blocking findings, the script stops immediately and exits 1.
If a platform times out or escalates, the script exits 2. If all configured
platforms are clean or skipped, the script exits 0. If a second instance is
detected for the same PR number, the script emits RESULT=escalate with
REASON=lock_contention and exits 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL).

Subcommands:
  unlock <pr-number>
    Remove the stale lock directory for a PR whose previous run crashed without
    cleaning up. Safe to run when no review loop is actively running for that PR.
    Use this to recover autonomously when lock_contention is reported but the
    recorded PID is no longer alive.

    Example:
      ./scripts/development-workflow/pr-review-loop.sh unlock 123

    The lock directory path is /tmp/pr-review-loop-<pr>.lockdir. You can also
    remove it manually with: rm -rf /tmp/pr-review-loop-<pr>.lockdir

--post-final-summary:
  Compatibility no-op. The script now posts or updates the
  "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment on every needs_fixes exit, not only
  final/max-cycle exits. Existing callers may keep passing this flag.

--compare:
  Run all configured platforms to completion regardless of individual verdicts
  (disables the short-circuit on the first blocking platform). After all platforms
  run, the overall exit code and RESULT are identical to what normal mode would
  produce: the first platform that would have blocked in config order governs.
  Per-platform verdicts are emitted as COMPARE_VERDICT_<n>_PLATFORM /
  COMPARE_VERDICT_<n>_RESULT key=value lines, and one row is appended to
  docs/workflow/retro-metrics-platforms.md. Intended for platform evaluation only —
  not for normal orchestration where early exit is desired.

--ready-phase:
  Mark one or more platforms as ready-phase reviewers that should run only after
  draft-phase GitHub reviewers are clean and the PR has been converted with
  gh pr ready. This does not override normal platform order; it emits
  READY_PHASE_* key=value telemetry and compatibility PHASE_AFTER_CLEAN_* keys.
  When omitted, the script reads review.on_ready.github from
  .ai-dev-workflow.yaml when present.

--phase-after-clean:
  Deprecated compatibility alias for --ready-phase.

--draft-github-only:
  Run only review.on_draft.github reviewers. Use this for draft PR gates that
  must clear draft-compatible GitHub reviewers before converting the PR to ready
  and allowing ready-phase reviewers to run.

--pre-after-clean-only:
  Deprecated compatibility alias for --draft-github-only.

Platform selection (in priority order):
  1. --platform flag(s) passed on the command line
  2. review.on_draft.github + review.on_ready.github in .ai-dev-workflow.yaml
     at the repo root
  3. Legacy review.platforms / review.phase_after_clean compatibility mapping

Branch-type-aware default timeout:
  On spec/* and implementation-plan/* branches, Devin has no trigger condition and
  exits immediately with REASON=no_check_run. To avoid wasting the full 20-minute
  default wait budget on these branches, the script automatically reduces
  --max-wait to PR_REVIEW_LOOP_DOC_MAX_WAIT seconds (default: 180) and
  --poll-interval to 30 s when the branch matches spec/* or
  implementation-plan/* and the caller did not pass the respective flag
  explicitly. poll_interval is also reduced when needed so it stays below
  max_wait — the per-loop timeout check requires elapsed >= max_wait, which can
  only fire after at least one poll_interval has elapsed. Pass --max-wait and/or
  --poll-interval explicitly to override either value.

Large-diff poll-window extension:
  CodeRabbit takes significantly longer to post its review on PRs with a large
  number of changed files (e.g., release PRs or sync-template PRs). When the
  caller did not pass --max-wait explicitly, the script fetches the PR's changed-
  files count and extends max_wait when it exceeds a threshold.

  Environment variables (both optional):
    LARGE_DIFF_THRESHOLD  — changed-files count above which the extension applies
                            (default: 50; must be a positive integer)
    LARGE_DIFF_MAX_WAIT   — extended max_wait in seconds for large-diff PRs
                            (default: 2400, i.e. 40 minutes; must be a positive integer)

  The extension is suppressed when --max-wait is passed explicitly. The emitted
  key=value output includes CHANGED_FILES_COUNT so callers can inspect the value.

Outputs stable key=value lines including:
  RESULT=clean|needs_fixes|needs_rerun|escalate|skipped
  PLATFORM_<n>_NAME / PLATFORM_<n>_RESULT
  REASON=lock_contention (when exit code is 75)
  CHANGED_FILES_COUNT=<n> (PR's changed-files count, or -1 when the fetch failed)
  LARGE_DIFF_EXTENDED=1 (present and set to 1 when max_wait was extended for a large-diff PR)
  REASON=late_review_threads (when post-clean recheck finds new unresolved threads)

  LATE_THREADS_FOUND=<N> (count of newly-found unresolved threads; -1 on audit failure; 0 when POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=0)

Environment variables:
  POST_CLEAN_WAIT=<seconds>          Override the post-clean recheck wait (default: 30). Set to 0 to run immediately.
  SKIP_POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=1          Suppress the post-clean recheck. Set by callers re-dispatching after a prior
                                     late-thread fix cycle, so the corrective invocation does not recheck again.
  FALLBACK_THREAD_SETTLE_WAIT=<sec>  Seconds to wait before running the thread audit when using
                                     coderabbit_status_success_fallback (default: 60). CodeRabbit can set a
                                     SUCCESS commit status before finishing its async inline-thread posting; this
                                     wait lets those threads arrive so the audit does not produce a false-clean.

  # Unlike check_unresolved_threads (GraphQL reviewThreads), this uses the REST
  # pulls-comments endpoint which includes outside-diff comments (line == null /
  # "LNone" in the GitHub UI). These outside-diff comments never create proper
  # GitHub review threads and are therefore invisible to the GraphQL query, but
  # they appear in the GitHub PR page as unresolved findings that reviewers can see.
  #
  # A root comment is considered "replied" when at least one reply comment exists
  # whose author is NOT the CodeRabbit bot (i.e., a human or agent acknowledgment).
  # CodeRabbit's own auto-acknowledgment replies do not count.
  # Comments containing "✅ Addressed" in the body are also excluded (self-resolved).

  # Root REST comments whose corresponding GraphQL review thread is already resolved
  # (isResolved=true) are also excluded. This prevents false-positive "unreplied"
  # counts when a reviewer resolves a thread via the GitHub UI without adding a reply:
  # the GraphQL isResolved flag reflects the true resolved state, so any REST comment
  # that belongs to an already-resolved thread must not block the review loop.

  #                                REST API returns the full login; unlike GraphQL, no stripping needed.

This file is append-only. One row is appended per compare-mode reviewer loop run.
Do not delete or rewrite existing rows. The "Block Was Real Bug?" column may be
filled in manually after a run when post-hoc analysis determines whether a
platform-exclusive blocking finding corresponded to a real code defect.

## Graduation Criteria

A platform may be considered safe for removal when, across 30 or more consecutive
compare-mode runs covering at least one run each of \`fix\`, \`feature\`, and \`refactor\`
branch types, it has zero platform-exclusive blocking findings (runs where that
platform blocked but at least one other configured platform was clean).

Fewer than 30 runs is always insufficient data for a graduation decision.

# restore_regression_label_if_missing — Step 7b regression-label auto-restore.
# Re-applies the ready-for-regression label at the start of every pr-review-loop.sh
# invocation for implementation branches so the label is always present when the CI
# loop (Step 8) begins — eliminating the recurring manual re-application pattern.
#
# Arguments:
#   $1  pr_number   — numeric PR number
#   $2  branch_name — full branch ref (e.g. fix/805-slug)
#
# Behaviour:
#   - Runs only for feature/*, fix/*, refactor/*, hotfix/* branches.
#   - Checks current label state via `gh pr view --json labels`.
#     On gh failure the check is skipped (fail-open; WARN emitted to stderr).
#   - When the label is absent, gates the restore on prior-loop evidence:
#     checks whether an "Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" comment already exists
#     on the PR via `gh api repos/.../issues/.../comments --paginate`.
#       • summary comment PRESENT + label missing  → RESTORE.
#         Within the reviewer-loop operating model, ready-for-regression is
#         owned by the loop and should be present whenever the loop runs after
#         the first summary comment. A label drop after the summary comment exists
#         means the PR policy workflow removed a stale label after a new push
#         (the #805 scenario), so restoring here is correct.
#       • summary comment ABSENT + label missing   → do NOT restore.
#         This is the normal initial state (loop has never run), and the only
#         window in which a human intentional removal is unambiguous. A deliberate
#         removal AFTER the loop has run while still re-invoking the loop is
#         treated as out-of-model (the loop will re-apply on the next invocation).
#     The summary-comment gate prevents overriding an intentional removal that
#     occurs before the loop has ever applied the label.
#   - If the comment-presence query fails (gh/API error): fail-open — the restore
#     IS attempted and a WARN is emitted. This mirrors the higher-frequency
#     real-world failure (#805) being more harmful than a spurious re-apply.
#   - The operation is idempotent: if the label is already present, gh pr edit
#     --add-label is a documented no-op.
#   - Marker: "### Automated Reviewer Loop Summary" (author-agnostic; the comment
#     is posted by the maintainer's gh token when run locally, not necessarily by
#     a bot account). Do NOT scope by [bot] — that silently misses local-run cases.
#
# Returns 0 in all cases (best-effort; never aborts the caller).

# --- Post-clean recheck ---
# After the reviewer loop exits clean and the immediate thread gate passes,
# wait a short interval and re-query reviewThreads. This catches bot review
# threads (e.g. CodeRabbit) that are posted asynchronously and arrive after
# the platform handlers and thread gate have already completed. Without this
# recheck, Step 5.1 must catch these late threads — at the cost of a full
# reviewer-loop redispatch cycle. The recheck adds a single ~30-second wait
# in exchange for avoiding that more expensive recovery path.
#
# The recheck only runs when:
#   - aggregate_result is "clean" after the immediate thread gate
#   - compare_mode is not active (recheck is not meaningful in evaluation mode)
#   - SKIP_POST_CLEAN_RECHECK is not set to "1" (allows callers to suppress
#     on re-dispatch after a prior late-thread fix cycle, so the recheck does
#     not run again on the corrective invocation)
#
# Configurable via POST_CLEAN_WAIT env var (default: 30 seconds).
# Emits POST_CLEAN_RECHECK=1 when the wait-and-recheck runs, and
# LATE_THREADS_FOUND=<N> with the count of newly-discovered unresolved threads.
