# AGENTS.md

This is the primary AI agent guidance file for this project. It follows the [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/agentsmd/agents.md) open format and is read by all AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.).

> **Note for Claude Code users**: `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file.

## Project Overview

**Finanzas** — a personal-finance app for people living in Chile. It reads their bank
movements, guides them through categorizing those movements in short sessions, and shows where
their money actually goes.

**The defining constraint:** bank credentials never leave the user's phone. Scraping runs
on-device in a hidden WebView; everything is stored in local SQLite. **There is no backend.**
Any change that would send a credential or a movement to a server contradicts the product.

**Users:** people in Chile with at least one bank account, who want visibility over their
spending without handing their banking password to a third party.

**MVP scope:** onboarding, Banco de Chile connection, sync, categorization, transactions,
dashboard, settings, local reminders. **There is no sign-in** — the profile is the device.
Auth, presupuestos, planificación and beneficios exist in the mockups (flagged `mvp: false`)
and are **out** of implementation scope. The tab bar is drawn with four tabs; the MVP renders
only Inicio and Transacciones.

### Non-negotiables

1. Credentials live only in `expo-secure-store`, only in the scraper's memory during a sync.
   Never in SQLite, never in a log, never in an error payload.
2. Money is `INTEGER` minor units. Never floats.
3. Bank movements are never deleted — only excluded from analysis, with a reason.
4. Re-syncing is idempotent.
5. Migrations are additive. A bad migration is unrecoverable on a user's device.
6. `design/mockups/mobile/` is the UI contract. Every UI item names the `#screen=…&state=…`
   it implements, and implements **every** state that screen declares — for screens that are
   in the MVP. Screens flagged `mvp: false` are not built. A UI item also registers its targets
   in `scripts/mobile-ui/fidelity-targets.json`, flips them from `planned` to `wired`, and
   attaches the fidelity summary table to its PR — see
   [`docs/best-practices/stack/mobile-ui-fidelity.md`](docs/best-practices/stack/mobile-ui-fidelity.md).
7. No account, no session, no auth secret. The app opens straight into onboarding.
8. **No user-facing literal strings in JSX.** Copy lives in `apps/mobile/src/i18n/` catalogues
   (`es` primary, `en` fallback); the Spanish string comes from the mockup.
9. No cross-package relative imports. Shared code is imported by its `@finanzas/*` name.
10. **Tracker status is manual.** `update-tracker-on-merge.yml` is disabled — it needs a PAT
    that is not configured. Set the project Status explicitly with `gh` at every stage
    transition and verify it with a live read. Never assume automation did it.

## Repository Structure

Turborepo + pnpm workspaces. Full detail in
[`docs/project/2-repo-architecture.md`](docs/project/2-repo-architecture.md).

Conventions follow [`zeki-platform`](https://github.com/lhpaul/zeki-platform): `apps/*` +
`packages/*` workspaces, scoped names, ESLint/Prettier at the repo root, theme and repositories
inside the app.

```
apps/mobile/                # @finanzas/mobile — the only shippable artifact
  app/                      # Expo Router routes, mirroring the mockup manifest
  src/
    components/ui/          # Design-system primitives mirroring design/tokens.json
    db/                     # Drizzle schema, migrations, seeds, repositories — the only SQL
    dev/                    # __DEV__-only surfaces (design-system gallery) — never ships
    features/               # One folder per domain area
    lib/ · hooks/ · i18n/ · types/ · test-utils/
    theme.ts                # Mirror of design/tokens.json
packages/
  shared-domain/            # Pure rules & domain types: no React, no SQL, no I/O
  shared-utils/             # CLP money, dates, RUT
  bank-scraper/             # On-device WebView scraping + per-bank script configs
design/                     # Tokens + HTML mockups (the UI contract)
docs/                       # Specs, best practices, AI workflow protocols
scripts/mobile-ui/          # Design-fidelity gate: manifest-driven mockup vs. app pixel diff
.maestro/                   # Device E2E flows
```

There is **no `packages/configs`** and **no UI package** — root ESLint config with per-app
overrides, and the theme lives at `apps/mobile/src/theme.ts`.

Layering: `app/ → feature hooks → src/db → SQLite`. Screens never import Drizzle.
`@finanzas/shared-domain` never imports from `apps/`, from `expo-*`, or from any SQL library.

Local, gitignored reference: `bank-scrapper-app/` (source for `packages/bank-scraper`;
Banco de Chile already implemented) and `personal-finances-app-mockups-v0/` (superseded).

> **Note for Cursor users**: Start from the workflow commands, especially `/run-item <target>` for single-item advancement. Cursor subagents in `.cursor/agents/` are configured internal/expert roles that Agent may delegate to after the command has resolved scope, guardrails, policy, and checkpoints; direct invocation of `item-orchestrator` is retained for internal handoff and legacy compatibility, not as the normal user-facing path. Each subagent's model is configured in its file — see [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/agent-model-config.md) for how to set or override models. This framework does not ship a `.cursor/skills/` mirror: Cursor discovers the existing agent, command, and shared `.agents/skills/` surfaces directly, and review tooling treats an absent Cursor skills tree as intentional rather than a missing mirror.

## Development Workflow

This project uses a staged AI-assisted development workflow. See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/README.md) for the full specification.

Repository-specific workflow providers are declared in [`.ai-dev-workflow.yaml`](.ai-dev-workflow.yaml). Today, `review.on_draft.runner` is consumed by the Step 7a internal review gate protocol, and `review.on_draft.github` / `review.on_ready.github` are consumed by `pr-review-loop.sh` (Step 7); other sections are advisory until additional tooling adopts them. Legacy `review.internal_reviewers`, `review.platforms`, and `review.phase_after_clean` keys remain accepted for one transition release.

**Prepare release** does not stop after opening PRs: protocol `05` treats `pr-review-loop.sh` as skipped for `release/*` branches, then applies `ready-for-regression` on the **production PR to `main`** and completes the CI loop (including label-gated e2e/regression when configured) before handoff to merge.

### Codex Skills

The repository ships Codex skill definitions in two compatible locations:

- `.agents/skills/`: repo-scoped Codex discovery path, including command-style aliases such as `/add-backlog-item`, `/run-work`, `/run-item`, `/run-items`, `/run-item-work` (deprecated alias), `/run-epic`, `/run-reviewer-loop`, `/batch-merge`, `/post-merge-cleanup`, `/post-merge-qa` (alias `/merged-qa-tester`), `/prepare-release`, `/graduate-development`, `/retrospective`, and `/sync-template`.
- `.codex/skills/`: legacy canonical workflow skill definitions used by existing template integrations.

Install them into your local Codex skill directories before first use:

<!-- workflow-shell-contract: bash -->
```bash
bash ./scripts/development-workflow/install-codex-skills.sh
```

Installed skills are thin wrappers around the canonical workflow protocols. They do not redefine the workflow; they load the same documents used by other tools and, for orchestration, rely on the helper scripts in `scripts/development-workflow/` to inspect state, resume partial work, and resolve PR readiness deterministically. `/run-item` and `/run-epic` are the primary bounded commands (shared prelude + Protocol 91 or 95). `/run-item` prints `policyRecommendation.confirmationSummary` before mutation and records an invocation-scoped item/policy binding after explicit autonomy flags or human acceptance so the same selected policy is not re-prompted. `/run-items` is the bounded multi-item batch execute command (Protocol 90 `explicit_list` mode — two or more items, targeting `develop` directly). `/run-work` is the read-only portfolio scan entrypoint via `run-work-router.sh` (Protocol 96) — it proposes batch options but does not execute; single/epic targets redirect to `/run-item` / `/run-epic`. In no-target scan mode, `/run-work` separates `INFORMATIONAL - not actionable in this proposal`, `ACTIONABLE RESUME - can advance now`, `PROPOSED BATCH - your decision`, and `HELD - not included in proposed batch` records; approval or the recommended `/run-items` command applies only to proposed-batch records. `/run-item-work` is a deprecated alias identical to `/run-item`. `/run-epic` resolves a bounded execution scope, recommends missing autonomy policy in-place before mutation, captures invocation-scoped delegation policy, uses read-only PR risk classification and `run-epic-delegated-gate.sh` before delegated merge decisions, and records stable PR disposition and epic ledger audit comments after delegated decisions. The command-style aliases exist for parity with Claude Code slash commands; the underlying canonical skills remain the source of the workflow behavior. The bundled skills also include optional `agents/openai.yaml` metadata so downstream projects created from this template have cleaner Codex skill labels and default prompts out of the box.

For normal Codex usage, use `/run-work` to scan the portfolio and discover what can advance (read-only — no mutation). Then execute with `/run-item` for a single item, `/run-items` for an explicit bounded batch, or `/run-epic` for an epic-scoped run. Use `/batch-merge` to merge ready PRs after execution. Use `/run-item` (not `/run-item-work`) for single-item advancement. Whether work is batch-orchestrated or item-scoped, runs should continue until they reach a real terminal condition: waiting on human review / merge, blocked dependency, unresolved decision, or escalation. For review gates, prefer the runner's native review capability against `REVIEW.md`; use the compatibility wrapper protocols only when a command, skill, or legacy workflow explicitly points to them.

## Important Conventions

### Git & Branching

This repository follows the default template workflow (documented in `docs/workflow/development-workflow/`).

- Integration branch: `develop` (spec/plan/feature/fix PRs target `develop`)
- Release branch: `main` (release PR targets `main`, plus a mandatory backport PR to `develop`)
- Branch naming:
  - Features / improvements: `feature/[feature-slug]` (from `develop`)
  - Refactors: `refactor/[slug]` (from `develop`)
  - Bug fixes (fast track): `fix/[slug]` (from `develop`)
  - Hotfixes: `hotfix/[slug]` (from `main`, then backport to `develop`)
  - Releases: `release/v[X.Y.Z]` (from `develop`)

Workflow branches must use a bare tracker identifier (for example,
fix/1858-safe-name), never an issue-reference form such as
fix/#1858-safe-name. The workflow guard rejects #, ?, ^, ~, :, backslash, and
spaces before branch creation or push. To recover already started work, preserve
the original branch, create a compliant replacement through the normal PR path,
verify push-triggered checks start, and never force-push shared history.

### Tracker Classification

When `issue_tracker.provider: github_projects` is configured, the GitHub
Projects **Type** field is the source of truth for work-item classification:
`Feature`, `Bug`, `Refactor`, or `Workflow`. Use `Workflow` for
AI-development-framework/process/tooling items. Do not use legacy repository
classification labels (`workflow`, `bug`, `enhancement`, or `type:*`) for new
automation; keep operational labels such as `ready-for-human-review`,
`needs-fixes`, `ready-for-regression`, `reviewer-failed`, and
`integration-branch:<slug>`.

### CHANGELOG & Versioning

- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.
- Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): patch for fixes/tweaks, minor for new features or meaningful improvements, major for breaking changes to the template structure.
- **Feature and fix PRs** merged into `develop` add entries under `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`; do not convert to a version number on merge. Spec-only and plan-only PRs are exempt. Fixes or changes to unreleased work should update the existing entry rather than adding a new one. In parallel batches, each PR adds its own CHANGELOG entry as normal; merge conflicts are resolved by the batch-merge auto-resolution (protocol 94 Step 4.3).
- **Hotfix PRs** (`hotfix/*`) are the exception: they write a **new versioned section** (e.g., `[1.0.1] - YYYY-MM-DD`) directly below `[Unreleased]` (above all prior versioned sections), not an `[Unreleased]` entry. A hotfix patches released code on `main` and is released immediately on merge — `auto-tag-release.yml` creates the corresponding tag automatically. The backport PR carries the versioned entry to `develop`.
- **A new version is created when releasing or hotfixing**: for normal releases, run the Prepare Release workflow (`/prepare-release` or `docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/05-prepare-release-protocol.md`) — that creates a `release/v[X.Y.Z]` branch, renames `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z]` in the CHANGELOG, opens PRs to `main` and backport to `develop`, then skips release-branch reviewer loops while driving regression + CI readiness on the **main** release PR before merge. For hotfixes, the developer writes the versioned section directly in Step 6 of Path 4 (`03-implement-development-protocol.md`) — no release branch is created.

### Agent commit hooks (optional — Haystack)

When `haystack hooks install` has been run, git uses `hooks/` for pre-commit enforcement on **AI agent** commits: truncation checks and `LLM_RULES.md` review (Option B — Entire session tracking not adopted; see integration doc for rationale). Human commits are unaffected. See [`docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/haystack.md`](docs/workflow/development-workflow/integrations/haystack.md). Customize `LLM_RULES.md` for your project; the template keeps `gh pr create` + protocol 93 as the default PR path.

### Stack Conventions

Read [`docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md`](docs/best-practices/STACK-SPECIFIC.md) for the stack summary and the most important cross-cutting rules. For detailed conventions per technology, see the files in [`docs/best-practices/stack/`](docs/best-practices/stack/).

### Safety Rules

- **No `git push --force`**, `git reset --hard`, or rebase on shared branches without explicit human approval
- **Stop and ask** if an action seems destructive or has wide blast radius
- Human review is required before merging PRs; opening a PR is not a terminal condition by itself

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Scraper hangs on `LOGIN_START` | The bank changed a selector. Run `pnpm --filter @finanzas/bank-scraper test` — the fixture tests fail before the app does. Re-capture and scrub a fixture, then fix the script |
| Duplicate movements after a sync | A write bypassed the repository upsert. All sync writes go through `(user_financial_product_id, external_id)` / `dedup_hash` |
| `home` and `dashboard` totals disagree | Someone hand-wrote an exclusion filter. A SQL query must use the shared `isIncluded` / `includedAmount` fragments from `apps/mobile/src/db`; in-memory code that already has a `Movement` object must use `isIncludedInAnalysis` / `effectiveAmount` / `contributedAmount` from `@finanzas/shared-domain`. These are the only two sanctioned statements of the rule — a third one anywhere is a review blocker |
| Amounts off by a factor of 100, or with decimals | Something treated CLP as having cents. Minor unit is the peso; amounts are `INTEGER`. `@finanzas/shared-utils`'s `formatClp` throws a `TypeError` on a non-integer input by design — that throw means a float already entered the money pipeline upstream, not a formatter bug |
| A transaction shows up in the wrong month | The local day was derived from the UTC timestamp instead of `@finanzas/shared-utils`'s `deriveDateLocal` |
| Native module missing at runtime | Needs a dev build, not Expo Go |
| App crashes on launch after an update | A migration threw. This is unrecoverable in the field — that is why `db:check` is a required check |
| `Unable to resolve "@expo/metro-runtime"` from `expo-router/entry-classic.js` | The installed `node_modules` tree is isolated, not hoisted (pnpm 11 does not read `node-linker` from `.npmrc`; it reads `nodeLinker` from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) | Run `pnpm check:layout` to confirm, then `pnpm install` (plain, no `--node-linker` flag) |
| `pnpm fidelity` captures the wrong device, or fails with "no booted simulator matches profile" | The booted simulator is not named `Finanzas Fidelity` | `xcrun simctl list devices booted`; boot or create `Finanzas Fidelity` per `docs/best-practices/stack/mobile-ui-fidelity.md` — `scripts/mobile-ui/capture-simulator.sh --check-only` prints the exact `simctl create` command |
