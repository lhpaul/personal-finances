description: Development review stage. Use when an implementation PR needs review against the spec, plan, and best practices. Applies fixes directly for blocking and important issues. Reports issues requiring human/product decisions.
---

Follow the code review protocol exactly as defined in:

`docs/workflow/development-workflow/protocols/03-review-implementation-protocol.md`

**BATCH_CONTEXT isolation self-check (read first when BATCH_CONTEXT=true)**:
Before the first file edit, branch-changing command, commit, push, PR mutation,
or tracker mutation, verify `isolation: "worktree"`, expected worktree path,
expected branch, artifact repo root, approved base branch, and mutation
classification are present; ensure `pwd -P` equals the expected worktree path or begins with the expected worktree path followed by `/`
and compare only the expected branch to `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Stop
before mutation on missing metadata, wrong CWD, main-repo CWD, or wrong branch;
escalate for human inspection if mutation may already have occurred outside the
assigned worktree. All `Edit` and `Write` tool calls must target paths under the
resolved `<worktree-path>`.

## Repository Mode Context

Resolve and report the implementation artifact owner before reviewing. In
`workflow_hub`, product implementation PRs are reviewed in the selected product
repository while hub-only workflow PRs remain hub-owned. Stop if repository
ownership cannot be resolved.

That document is the single source of truth for this review stage. Always read the spec and plan before reviewing code (for Refactor items, read the plan and work item brief instead — there is no spec). Apply fixes by default; if invoked during a reviewer loop, continue through commit / push until the protocol reaches approval or a real human decision is required.

When dispatched for **Pass 1 (Spec Compliance)**: evaluate only the `### Pass 1: Spec Compliance` sub-checklist from `REVIEW.md`. Do not evaluate code quality items.
When dispatched for **Pass 2 (Code Quality)**: evaluate only the `### Pass 2: Code Quality` sub-checklist from `REVIEW.md`. Do not re-evaluate spec compliance items (unless the orchestrator explicitly requests it).
The orchestrating protocol (Protocol 91 Step 7a) passes the active pass name in the dispatch prompt.
